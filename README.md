# hello-world

Hello,

My name is andrew.  I have been teaching code to myself for a few months and have a background in applied economics.  Cryptocurrency, bitcoin, and the blockchain is what brought me to programming.  I've taught myself some HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.  I've decided to focus on Python and hope to one day start contributing to the blockchain community!
